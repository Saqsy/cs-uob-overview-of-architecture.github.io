# Welcome
Welcome to the unit!

The [unit's Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A-C1mntYz_enrIpuskEuaHKfzw5YsxUKp7drZk2gre8g1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=9f51e45f-a8c1-4e5d-a0bf-12553fc32b76&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b) is now live, where you can post any questions - we’ll be keeping an eye on it throughout the term.
 
Week 1 materials are now available on [the unit’s GitHub page](https://cs-uob-overview-of-architecture.github.io/#schedule-and-links-to-materials). There’s lots of information there, so it’d be useful to have a browse when you can. No need to look at anything before our first workshop on Monday though, as it’ll just be an introduction to the course, how it’s structured, and plenty of time for questions.
 
Our Tuesday Q&A will be the first point where it’ll be useful to have reviewed the week 1 materials, as that session is all about helping you make sense of the lecture content - we’ll go over the logistics of all sessions properly on Monday.
 
All the best,

Kira and John

## Week 5 content and important test announcements

Week 5 materials are now live on the unit's GitHub page! As we move into the second part of the course, some important announcements **concerning the test next week worth 40% of your unit mark**, so **please read them!**

First, and worthy of a paragraph rather than a bullet point, this week's video lectures are **not** examinable on our in-class test next week. They are, however, the foundation for literally everything in the second in-class test in week 13, and **it is vital that you take the time to understand them**. If you absolutely must ignore week 5 for now while you focus on revision, then catching up in week 7 is a viable strategy to some extent - the material in week 7 is about "filling in the gap" between assembly language as introduced this week and the hardware of week 1-4, and most of it (while examinable) will not come up again in weeks 8-11. You can't just skip week 5 altogether and hope things will work out, though. Absolutely nothing in weeks 7-11 will make any sense if you don't have a working knowledge of Hack assembly. You're going to have a bad time.

The remaining announcements are shorter and simpler:

* Practice papers for the test are available [here](../practice).
* Details of the test rules are available [here](../exam). Note in particular that:
    * You will have access to [this reference sheet](../exam_files/reference.pdf). You are **not** allowed to bring in any other notes or access any other notes from within the exam room.
    * You are allowed to use the built-in lab calculators, but you are **not** allowed to use physical calculators or the "programming" modes which allow you to e.g. convert between  binary and decimal numbers.
	* You are **only** allowed to use the test version of Logisim ("LogiExam"). You are **not** allowed to use Logisim Evolution. Annoyingly, Logisim Evolution is the default file association with .circ files, so this you should not open the skeleton by double-clicking it. (We'll go round at the start to make sure everyone has the right version open...)
    * You are **not** allowed to start writing things or checking notes between coming into the room and the start of the exam. 
    * We will be running occasional random checks during the exam to make sure you have no banned software or materials open. If this happens, don't worry, it will only take a few seconds.
	* At the start of the test you will need to remove your coat (so dress warm!), bags, and electronic devices and leave them at the front of the room,
	* Remember to bring your student ID, writing materials, and a water bottle (with no label).
* We will start ASAP after **1pm on Friday 31st**. If you don't have an SSP, the test will last for **two hours** and will take place in **MVB 2.11** (the same room as labs). If you do have an SSP which requires alternative exam arrangements, you should have received a separate email from the school office with details about timing and venue - you will likely be in MVB 1.15, MVB 1.07 or MVB 2.59.
* Next Wednesday (the 29th) we will be running a **bonus two-hour Q&A session** at 2pm focused on weeks 1-4 to help with revision. Like all our Q&As, attendance is optional but encouraged if there's any part of the unit you've been having trouble with. You should have this in your timetables - it's in Pugsley lecture theatre in Queens at 2pm. (If you haven't been to Queens before, it is a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. You **must** enter via the main entrance on University Walk/Tankard's Close and follow the signposts or you will wander lost for 15+ minutes. More detailed directions are available [here](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/learning-facilities/central-teaching-spaces/queens-building/140-pugsley-lecture-theatre/).
* **There will be a "mock test" at the start of Thursday labs at 1pm.** This is optional (and has no marks associated with it) but is recommended anyway. Basically, the mock test will be a dress rehearsal for the real test in every way except the test paper, which will be effectively blank. It will likely take about 15-30 minutes, and will be a chance to see what the procedures will be for the real thing next week. 

Best wishes,

John and Kira
