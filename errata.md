Any errata will be linked from the video itself on the front page and fixed in the slides, so there's no need to keep checking back here.

## Week 1 intro talk

Slide 7 referred to the "Tuesday live sessions" - Tuesday should have read Monday, these are the normal workshops you have timetabled from 1pm-3pm.

## Week 5 video 4

Part of the video shows a version of slide 3 with 15 bits stored under "Contents" rather than 16 bits.
